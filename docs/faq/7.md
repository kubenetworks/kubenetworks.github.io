# On Linux, Once use kubevpn connect to k8s cluster network, then lost connection to internet network?

## Reason

There is no optimal method for setting up DNS in the Linux system, as there are numerous types of Linux distributions.

## Expect

Set up a separate DNS for the `tun` device

## Resolve

Install tools `resolvectl`

When `resolvectl` is not installed by default, it can be added to the system by following step

### (1) Install tools `resolvectl`

Package information for `resolvectl`

| Operating system         | Package name     | Installation                   |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| AlmaLinux                | systemd-resolved | `dnf install systemd-resolved` |
| Arch Linux               | systemd          | `pacman -S systemd`            |
| Debian                   | systemd          | `apt install systemd`          |
| Fedora                   | systemd-resolved | `dnf install systemd-resolved` |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | systemd-resolved | `dnf install systemd-resolved` |
| Rocky Linux              | systemd-resolved | `dnf install systemd-resolved` |
| Ubuntu                   | systemd          | `apt install systemd`          |

### (2) Verify install

Once installed, you can enable the service by command:

```shell
systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service
```

```shell
systemctl start systemd-resolved.service
```

try command:

```shell
resolvectl status
```

it shows the information related to name resolution coming from the resolve daemon.

### (3) Reboot

Please reboot computer, this is very important.

after reboot computer, use `kubevpn connect` to connect, all thing should works fine.
