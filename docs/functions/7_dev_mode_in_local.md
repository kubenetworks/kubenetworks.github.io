# Dev mode in local 🐳

Run the Kubernetes pod in the local Docker container, and cooperate with the service mesh to intercept the traffic with
the specified header to the local, or all the traffic to the local.

You can see that it will start up two containers with docker, mapping to pod two container, and share port with same
network, you can use `localhost:port`
to access another container. And more, all environment、volume and network are the same as remote kubernetes pod, it is
truly consistent with the kubernetes runtime. Makes develop on local PC comes true.

```shell
➜  ~ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                                NAMES

```

Here is how to access pod in local docker container

```shell
export authors_pod=`kubectl get pods -l app=authors -n default -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`
export authors_pod_ip=`kubectl get pod $authors_pod -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.podIP}'`
curl -kv -H "a: 1" http://$authors_pod_ip:80/health
```

Verify logs of nginx container

```shell
docker logs $(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep nginx_default_kubevpn)
```

If you just want to start up a docker image, you can use simple way like this:

```shell
kubevpn dev deployment/authors --no-proxy -it --rm
```

Example：

```shell
➜  ~ kubevpn dev deployment/authors --no-proxy -it --rm
connectting to cluster
start to connect
got cidr from cache
get cidr successfully
update ref count successfully
traffic manager already exist, reuse it
port forward ready
tunnel connected
dns service ok

```

Now the main process will hang up to show you log.

If you want to specify the image to start the container locally, you can use the parameter `--docker-image`. When the
image does not exist locally, it will be pulled from the corresponding mirror warehouse. If you want to specify startup
parameters, you can use `--entrypoint` parameter, replace it with the command you want to execute, such
as `--entrypoint /bin/bash`, for more parameters, see `kubevpn dev --help`.
